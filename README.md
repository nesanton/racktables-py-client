racktables-py-client
====================

Initially forked from https://github.com/ibettinger/racktables.
The purpose of the lib has eventually changed. Although it can still be used as a python wrapper to [ibettinger](https://github.com/ibettinger)'s php api (actually to my fork of it), it mainly serves as ansible module util (something that ansible module imports) for my [module](https://github.com/nesanton/racktables_ansible)
